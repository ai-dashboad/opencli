**Last Updated**: February 2, 2026

## Introduction

OpenCLI ("we", "our", or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our mobile application.

## Information We Collect

### 1. Device Information
We collect basic device information for proper app functionality:
- **Device ID**: Used for device pairing and authentication
- **Device Model and OS Version**: Used for compatibility and troubleshooting
- **Network Information**: Required for connecting to your local daemon service

**How we use it**: This information enables the app to connect to your personal computer and maintain secure communication.

### 2. Voice Data (Optional)
When you use voice commands:
- **Microphone Access**: Required for speech-to-text functionality
- **Voice Input**: Temporarily processed to understand your commands

**How we use it**: Voice data is processed locally on your device using the speech_to_text service. **We do NOT store, transmit, or share your voice recordings with any third parties or cloud services.**

### 3. Usage Data
We may collect anonymous usage statistics to improve the app:
- **Crash Reports**: Helps us fix bugs and improve stability
- **Feature Usage**: Helps us understand which features are most valuable

**How we use it**: This data is aggregated and anonymized. It helps us prioritize development efforts and fix issues.

## Data Storage and Security

### Local Storage
- All user data is stored locally on your device
- No cloud storage or remote servers are used for your personal data
- Communication with your computer is direct (peer-to-peer) when possible

### Encryption
- All communications between the mobile app and your computer use **end-to-end encryption**
- Device pairing uses cryptographic keys to prevent unauthorized access
- Sensitive operations require user confirmation

### No Third-Party Sharing
**We do NOT sell, trade, or transfer your personal information to third parties.** The only external services we use are:
- **Google Play Services**: For app distribution and updates (managed by Google)
- **AI Model Providers** (Optional): If you choose to use cloud AI features, queries may be sent to:
  - Anthropic (Claude API)
  - OpenAI (GPT API)
  - Google (Gemini API)

  **Note**: You can configure the app to use local AI models only (via Ollama) if you prefer complete privacy.

## Permissions Explained

### Why We Need Each Permission

| Permission | Purpose | Required/Optional |
|------------|---------|-------------------|
| **Internet** | Connect to your computer's daemon service | Required |
| **Microphone** | Voice command input | Optional |

### Permission Control
- You can revoke permissions at any time through your device settings
